    YOU'LL EXPLORE ONE OF THE GREAT MYSTERIES OF ANCIENT ERLANG (SPOILER ALERT: THERE ARE NO SAFETY MEASURES IN PLACE).

	TELL US JUST ONE GOOD THING YOU DID ON EARTH ? ...WELL, WE HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT WHAT YOU JUST SAID... SOO, MAYBE WE SHOULD EXPLAIN SOME OF THE FINER POINTS OF THE LAW ON ERLANG: if you don't want to use magic, feel free to go back to the <a href="/" title="">First Landing.</a> And don't confuse this magic with the magic we talked before.
